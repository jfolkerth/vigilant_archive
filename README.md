## Description

This is a combination playground project so that I can learn Rust and digital assistant for an upcoming tabletop role-playing game I intend to run.

The project name comes from a combination of GitHub's random repo name suggestion and my own word preferences. It may change as the app grows and I understand better what it will be.

## Local Development

This project assumes a local rust setup with cargo and common tools like clippy and rustfmt. Trunk is used for packaging and serving the webapp. Follow the instructions for the relevant tooling to install.

Standard cargo commands are used for build and test. `trunk serve` will run a local instance of the webapp.
